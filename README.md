# scrumdo-mcp

Connect any MCP-compatible AI tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and others) directly to your [ScrumDo](https://www.scrumdo.com) boards.

Once installed, your AI assistant can read cards, move them, create tasks, post comments, and search across your board — without you copy-pasting anything.

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install scrumdo-mcp
```

---

## Setup

### Step 1 — Get your token

Log in to ScrumDo → your organization → **Settings → API Tokens → Create Token**.

Copy the token — it is only shown once. This is your personal key; keep it private.

### Step 2 — Configure your AI tool

Find your tool's MCP config file and add the `scrumdo` server entry:

| Tool | Config file |
|------|-------------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/claude.json` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` |

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "scrumdo": {
      "command": "scrumdo-mcp",
      "env": {
        "SCRUMDO_TOKEN": "your-token-here",
        "SCRUMDO_ORG": "your-org-slug",
        "SCRUMDO_PROJECT": "your-default-project-slug"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Your org slug and project slug are the short names in your board URL:
`app.scrumdo.com/`**`my-company`**`/`**`engineering`**

### Step 3 — Restart your AI tool

Done. Your AI assistant now has direct access to your board.

## What you can do

Once connected, just talk to your AI tool naturally:

```
"What's the status of ENG-42?"
"Move ENG-42 to In Review and add a comment saying the PR is up"
"List all cards assigned to me in the current sprint"
"Create a sub-task on ENG-42: write release notes"
"Search for cards about the login bug"
"What did the team work on this week?"
```

## Token scope

Your API token is restricted to your organization's board data only — cards, tasks, comments, members, iterations. It cannot access billing, account settings, or any other organization's data. Revoke it at any time from Settings → API Tokens.

---

## What is MCP?

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is an open standard for connecting AI tools to external services. Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI editors support it natively. Install the server once; any MCP-compatible tool can use it.
